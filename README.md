# Regex Data Extraction  

This project extracts specific types of data (emails, URLs, phone numbers, and money amounts) from text using **Python and Regular Expressions (Regex)**.  

## í³Œ How It Works  
1. **Provide some text** â€“ The program searches through this text.  
2. **Use regex patterns** â€“ It looks for emails, links, phone numbers, and prices.  
3. **Find and display matches** â€“ The results are printed.  

## í»  Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- No extra libraries needed (only built-in `re` module)  

## íº€ How to Run  
1. Copy the **Python code** into a file (e.g., `extractor.py`).  
2. Run the script using:  
   ```bash
   python extractor.py
